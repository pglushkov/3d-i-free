Hey there!

I guess you'll definatelly check a file with such a pretty name, so here's da message.

You've told me, that you wanted to kick-off with some simple 2d example, so i've assempled one for ya.
Check the code at ./WORKBENCH/get_started_example. It's a messy c-style code, but i hope it will be
clear enough to catch some basic concepts and to have some actual code to start playing around with.
But when you do start changing it - please, form some another folder from it, cause this one is easy
enough to painlessly add some quick changes, debug some shit, twist some matrix, etc. It's not completely
finished for now, i also want to add a projection matrix to the code, cause (MUHAHA) Z-axis behaves
insanely when no projection is used. I don't really want to add a camera to this example. Anyway - without
it we can just think that camera transform is equal to unity-matrix.

I've tried to leave some short comments on actions taking place in the code, but please feel free to ask
any questions.

As always, eat a dick :)  8======================================================================================Ð­ (yeah, that's me)
