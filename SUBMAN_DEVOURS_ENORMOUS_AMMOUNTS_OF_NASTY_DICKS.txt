Hey there!

I guess you'll definatelly check a file with such a pretty name, so here's da message.

You've told me, that you wanted to kick-off with some simple 2d example, so i've assempled one for ya.
Check the code at ./WORKBENCH/get_started_example. It's a messy c-style code, but i hope it will be
clear enough to catch some basic concepts and to have some actual code to start playing around with.
But when you do start changing it - please, form some another folder from it, cause this one is easy
enough to painlessly add some quick changes, debug some shit, twist some matrix, etc. It's not completely
finished for now, i'll also add:
	- camera/projection
	- texturing
Or, if you want, you can add these things yoself, plenty of examples are at ./utils and ./camera_rotate_example

I've tried to leave some short comments on actions taking place in the code, but please feel free to ask
any questions.

As always, eat a dick :)  8======================================================================================Ð­ (yeah, that's me)
